# vocabularyclassicalconditioning
This is a project for one of my classes that helps you learn some vocabulary words. Not much classical conditioning, but a lot of vocabulary words.
It took me 3 days to make this program, which might seem like a long time for code so simple, but my last project like this (over a year ago) took me several months, and it doesn't even have half as much depth as this, so I see it as an improvement.
Otherwise, there isn't much else to this project, but it can be used by other people once I finish it up and compile it (hopefully).
